Like a television could be both $100 and $600 easily. The heavy but cheap was more difficult than expensive but light. For the reciept section it was tempting to say department store for everything since it could almost always be Walmart any for some of those price ranges it's hard to imagine fitting the things into the budget, like even cheap things at a furniture store are still quite expensive.
